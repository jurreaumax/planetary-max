# Portal-OS — Rebuild 2

**Integrated Operating System Architecture**

> Rebuild 1 proved the system works.  
> Rebuild 2 makes the system whole.

Portal-OS is a distributed operating system built on Cloudflare Workers, with a kernel written in Python and a cognitive architecture built on SIM (Symbolic Intelligent Model).

## Rebuild 2 — What It Is

Rebuild 2 is the **integration rebuild** — the phase where Portal-OS transforms from a set of working components into a **unified, internally coherent operating system**.

### Purpose

Transform Rebuild 1's successful deploy state into a fully integrated Portal-OS architecture where every subsystem is wired together into a single deterministic runtime.

### Key Additions

1. **Worker → Kernel Bridge** — Message bridge between Worker entrypoint and Kernel boot
2. **Kernel Initialization Sequence** — Formalizes invariants, module loading, scheduler startup, governance + identity registration
3. **Multi-Domain Scheduler** — Cognitive, orchestration, substrate, and governance lanes
4. **SIM Cognitive Wiring** — Kernel → SIM integration (Core, State, Trajectory, Compute)
5. **TEC Execution Layer** — Pipelines, agents, surfaces, governance hooks
6. **Identity + Governance Enforcement** — Wired into routing, orchestration, kernel invariants
7. **Routing Table** — Deterministic routing from Worker → Kernel → SIM → TEC → Substrate → Worker
8. **Substrate State Model** — DO state, KV persistence, substrate invariants

## Rebuild 2 — Build Order

1. ✓ Worker → Kernel bridge
2. ✓ Kernel boot + invariants
3. ✓ Scheduler domain lanes
4. ✓ SIM wiring
5. ✓ TEC pipelines
6. ✓ Identity + governance
7. ✓ Routing table
8. ✓ Substrate state model
9. ✓ MAX-OS-1 universe adapter
10. ✓ Full integration test

## System Invariants

Portal-OS maintains these invariants across all layers:

### Tier 1: Foundational
- **State Coherence** — System state must be consistent across all layers
- **No Silent Failures** — Every failure must be logged and escalated

### Tier 2: Security
- **Authorization Enforced** — Every operation must be authorized
- **Identity Established** — Every message must carry valid identity

### Tier 3: Messaging
- **Message Ordering** — Intra-domain ordering is strict
- **No Message Loss** — Every message is processed or explicitly rejected
- **Message Timeout** — Messages have bounded age

### Tier 4: Concurrency
- **Scheduler Cycles Complete** — Cycles complete within bounded time
- **No Deadlock** — Lanes never deadlock each other

### Tier 5: Substrate
- **Substrate Consistent** — DO + KV state synchronized
- **KV Eventual Consistency** — System handles eventual consistency gracefully

### Tier 6: Execution
- **SIM Trajectory Valid** — SIM state trajectory is always valid
- **TEC Execution Bounded** — TEC agents complete within bounded time

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- Node.js 18+
- Cloudflare Workers account

### Running Kernel Boot
```bash
python kernel/boot.py
```

This will execute the full boot sequence:
1. Load invariants
2. Load modules
3. Start scheduler
4. Register governance
5. Register identity

### Worker and Kernel Bridge

Cloudflare Workers cannot start local subprocesses. Deploy the Python adapter
separately and configure either a `KERNEL_SERVICE` service binding or a
`KERNEL_URL` Worker variable. For local adapter development:

```bash
python kernel/http_adapter.py --port 8788
```

The one-message synchronous bridge is also available directly:

```bash
export PORTAL_SERVICE_TOKEN="a-locally-generated-secret"
printf '%s' '{"id":"demo","type":"sim","payload":{},"identity":"a-locally-generated-secret","governanceContext":{}}' \
  | python kernel/boot.py --message
```

Identity tokens are loaded from `PORTAL_SYSTEM_TOKEN`, `PORTAL_SERVICE_TOKEN`,
and `PORTAL_OBSERVER_TOKEN`; there are no built-in production credentials.
Use independently generated, opaque URL-safe values backed by 32–64 random
bytes. The GUI must send one exact configured value as
`Authorization: Bearer <token>`. The Worker classifies it as `admin`,
`operator`, or `observer` and sends the kernel an identity envelope containing
the subject, role, capabilities, and a proof. The kernel independently checks
that proof and rejects a forged classification. The service token has operator
access, the observer token can read autonomy/universe state, and observers are
denied access to `POST /universe/tick`. Keep these values in deployment secrets;
do not hard-code them in browser bundles, logs, or repository files.

The high-level Worker endpoints (`GET /api/autonomy`, `GET /universe/state`,
`GET /universe/umbrella`, and `POST /universe/tick`) return a shared contract:

```json
{"ok":true,"data":{},"meta":{"messageId":"...","type":"universe.state","identity":{},"route":["orchestration"]}}
```

On failure, the Worker preserves the structured kernel response and HTTP
status. GUI clients should parse the JSON response before throwing and display
`error.code` together with `error.message` (for example `UNAUTHENTICATED`,
`FORBIDDEN`, or `INVALID_MESSAGE`).

### Umbrella licensing exports

The five core Umbrella physics lanes are exposed under `/api/umbrella/*`:

- `POST /api/umbrella/identity`
- `POST /api/umbrella/governance`
- `POST /api/umbrella/structural`
- `POST /api/umbrella/physics`
- `POST /api/umbrella/routing`

Each lane returns normalized JSON with the verified identity envelope in
`meta.identity` and its active physics contract in `data`. Licensed product
routes below are also available with the `/api` prefix; the legacy `/umbrella/*`
paths remain available for existing clients.

The Worker exposes two kernel-authorized SIM product exports:

- `POST /umbrella/identity/license` routes to `identity.physics.license`.
- `POST /umbrella/governance/license` routes to `governance.engine.license`.

Both require a `tier` with one of the values `basic`, `professional`, or
`enterprise`, and may include an optional `input` object for the SIM model:

```json
{"tier":"professional","input":{}}
```

They return the same normalized contract as the universe endpoints:

```json
{"ok":true,"data":{"tier":"professional"},"meta":{"messageId":"...","type":"identity.physics.license","identity":{},"route":["orchestration"]}}
```

The bearer identity's registry attribute `licenseTier` is authoritative. The
Worker forwards `tier` unchanged, and the kernel caps it to the authorized
tier before the SIM export filters fields. Response data includes `tier`,
`requestedTier`, `authorizedTier`, and `tierCapped` for client messaging. Set
`PORTAL_SYSTEM_LICENSE_TIER`,
`PORTAL_SERVICE_LICENSE_TIER`, or `PORTAL_OBSERVER_LICENSE_TIER` alongside the
corresponding token to grant a built-in environment-backed identity a tier.
Supported values are `basic`, `professional`, and `enterprise`; identities
without an explicit valid tier cannot use licensing exports.

Identity Physics outputs are progressively licensed as identity signature,
stability metrics, and curvature vectors. Governance Engine outputs are
progressively licensed as mode and structure, apex alignment, and collapse
vectors. Invalid or missing request tiers return `INVALID_MESSAGE`; missing
bearer entitlements return `FORBIDDEN`.

### Apex advisory and simulation packs

Two additional Umbrella revenue products use the same bearer entitlement and
normalized response contract:

- `POST /umbrella/apex/advisory` routes to `apex.alignment.advisory` and
  returns a deterministic apex vector and alignment score. Professional adds a
  structural alignment map; enterprise adds collapse-vector risk.
- `POST /umbrella/sim/pack` routes to `umbrella.sim.pack` and returns pack
  version, composition, stability, deterministic seed, and SIM payloads.

Both accept the same request shape:

```json
{"tier":"professional","input":{}}
```

The Worker forwards the bearer and requested `tier` unchanged. The kernel caps
the tier before SIM export and reports the effective tier in normalized
`{"ok":true,"data":{...},"meta":{...}}` responses. Basic packs contain the
identity SIM; professional packs add governance and apex SIMs; enterprise
packs add the market SIM.

### Market forecasts and identity mirrors

The SET 3 Umbrella products use the same request, entitlement, and normalized
response contract:

- `POST /umbrella/market/forecast` routes to `umbrella.market.forecast`.
  Basic includes the deterministic market vector and trend projection;
  professional adds the volatility band; enterprise adds collapse-vector risk.
- `POST /umbrella/identity/mirror` routes to `umbrella.identity.mirror`.
  Basic includes the deterministic mirrored identity signature; professional
  adds behavioral projection and the structural truth map; enterprise adds the
  quantum-branch preview.

Both accept:

```json
{"tier":"professional","input":{}}
```

The Worker forwards bearer and `tier` unchanged. The kernel caps the requested
tier to the bearer entitlement before the SIM export filters detail, then the
Worker returns normalized `{"ok":true,"data":{...},"meta":{...}}` JSON.

### Crossworld access and structural truth

The SET 4 Umbrella products complete the licensed surface with two additional
kernel-authorized operations:

- `POST /umbrella/crossworld/access` routes to `umbrella.crossworld.access`.
  Basic includes the access signature and reachable worlds; professional adds
  the traversal map; enterprise adds quantum-bridge detail.
- `POST /umbrella/structural/truth/license` routes to
  `structural.truth.license`. Basic includes the truth signature and coherence;
  professional adds the structural truth map; enterprise adds contradiction
  vectors.

Both routes forward the bearer identity and requested `tier` unchanged to the
kernel. Entitlement resolution and product logic remain in the TEC licensing
pipeline; the Worker only normalizes the kernel response.

### Portal GUI

The GUI is an isolated Vite + React package in `portal-os-gui/`. For local
development:

```bash
cd portal-os-gui
npm ci
npm run dev
```

The development environment points to
`https://planetary-max.jurreaumax.workers.dev`. The browser sends the configured
bearer token only for the current in-memory session.

For Cloudflare Pages use:

- Project root: `portal-os-gui`
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Output directory: `dist`
- Environment variable: `API_BASE_URL=https://planetary-max.jurreaumax.workers.dev`

`VITE_API_BASE_URL` is also accepted. The build rejects the inactive
`https://api.portal-os.com` hostname and falls back to the Workers URL. Once
the custom domain's Cloudflare DNS and TLS are active, set either URL variable
to `https://api.portal-os.com`, set `PORTAL_OS_CUSTOM_DOMAIN_ACTIVE=true`, and
rebuild the Pages deployment.

Set `MAXOS_MODULE` to the installed MAX-OS-1 Python module exporting
`MaxOsUnifiedOrchestrator`. Without it, a deterministic in-memory universe is
used for local development and integration tests.

### Production deployment

The edge Worker declares `KERNEL_SERVICE -> portal-kernel` in the production
environment. Deploy the private Python kernel first, then deploy the edge
Worker so Wrangler can resolve the service binding:

```bash
npx wrangler login

# Configure the same independently generated values on both Workers.
npx wrangler secret put PORTAL_SYSTEM_TOKEN --env production
npx wrangler secret put PORTAL_SERVICE_TOKEN --env production
npx wrangler secret put PORTAL_OBSERVER_TOKEN --env production

cd portal-kernel-worker
uv sync --locked
bash kernel_cli.sh secret put PORTAL_SYSTEM_TOKEN --env production
bash kernel_cli.sh secret put PORTAL_SERVICE_TOKEN --env production
bash kernel_cli.sh secret put PORTAL_OBSERVER_TOKEN --env production
bash kernel_cli.sh deploy --env production
cd ..
npx wrangler deploy --env production
```

Generate each secret locally and paste it only into Wrangler's prompt, for
example `python -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))'`. Do not
reuse one value for multiple roles. Use `npx wrangler deploy --dry-run --env
production` to validate the edge artifact without publishing it.
